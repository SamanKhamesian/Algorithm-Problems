# Disjoint-Set

Disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

It supports two useful operations:

##### Find(x)
* Determine which subset a particular element is in.
Find typically returns an item from this set that serves as its "representative"; by comparing the result of two Find operations, one can determine whether two elements are in the same subset.

##### Merge(x, y)
* Join two subsets into a single subset.


#### Input parameters
* `n` : Number of elements
* `m` : Number of connections

#### Results
* `result` : Two sets can be merge or not.
