# Breadth-first search (BFS)

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

#### Variables
* `n` : Number of nodes in graph
* `m` : Number of edges in graph

#### Parameters
* `start` : Starting node (Source node)

#### Results
* `dist` : Array of minimum distances from source node to the others.
* `parent` : Array of parents for the shortest path between source node and target node.
