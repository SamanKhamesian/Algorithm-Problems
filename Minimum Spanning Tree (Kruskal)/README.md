#  Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
It connects all the vertices together with the minimal total weighting for its edges.
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. 
More generally, any undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of minimum spanning trees for its connected components.

#### Variables
* `n` : Number of nodes in graph
* `m` : Number of edges in graph
* `graph` : List pair nodes like (`i`, `j`) with the weight of their edge

#### Results
* `result` : Sum of the weights of the MST edges
